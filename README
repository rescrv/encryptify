Encryptify
==========

Encryptify encrypts and decrypts using symmetric key cryptography.  It is
inspired by the signify[1] tool in OpenBSD, to the extent that it even borrows
some of signify's source.

Examples
--------

Create a new key pair:
      $ encryptify -G -p newkey.pub -s newkey.sec

Encrypt stdin and write it to stdout:
      $ encryptify -E -p key.pub

Encrypt a named file:
      $ encryptify -E -p key.pub file

Decrypt stdin and write it to stdout:
      $ encryptify -D -s key.sec

Decrypt a named file:
      $ encryptify -D -s key.sec file


To Install
----------

    apt-get install libbsd-dev
    autoreconf -ivf # (only needed if compiling from git, not tarball)
    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

To Update
---------

    mkdir openbsd
    tar xzf /path/to/OpenBSD/src.tar.gz -C openbsd
    OPENBSD_SOURCE=openbsd ./update.sh

This will automatically pull in sources that were copied from the OpenBSD
source tree and patch them as necessary.  The update script was built for 5.8
and may need changes in the future.
